# What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is an unfalsifiable and incorruptible public ledger of transactions. It is a decentralized, distributed database, so instead of one person controlling everything, there are thousands of nodes connected to the network, and these thousands of nodes together come to an agreement to validate all the transactions that has been made.

The technology was invented in 2008 to power Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto. Despite was originally devised for digital currency we have now found multiple other uses for the technology.

#### Is Blockchain the same as Bitcoin?

“[Blockchain] is to Bitcoin, what the internet is to email. A big electronic system, on top of which you can build applications. Currency is just one.” 
> Sally Davies, FT Technology Reporter

## Why I am interested in Blockchain?
Blockchain is a hot topic around the world these days. Considerated by lot of people as the backbone of a new type of internet. It is definitly a must to learn about it.

A quote that I like for one of the best minds, if not the best, working with this technology:

“Blockchain solves the problem of manipulation. When I speak about it in the West, people say they trust Google, Facebook, or their banks. But the rest of the world doesn’t trust organizations and corporations that much — I mean Africa, India, the Eastern Europe, or Russia. It’s not about the places where people are really rich. Blockchain’s opportunities are the highest in the countries that haven’t reached that level yet.”
> Vitalik Buterin, inventor of Ethereum


To a better understanding of Blockchain and to develop this Project I followed the amazing article published in Medium:

Also I would strongly recommend to watch this simple explanaition about what Blockchain is, to a better understanding:
